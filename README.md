# Secure Net Stack

Secure Net Stack is a modular Python framework for building secure network nodes with encryption.  
It provides a networking layer (`SecureSocket`), an encryption layer (`SecureChannel`), and a node layer (`NetworkNode`) that combines both.

This repository is intended for developers who want to quickly prototype secure communication systems or contribute enhancements to the network stack.

## Features

- Secure socket networking
- Encrypted communication channels
- Modular and testable design
- Example scripts for demo purposes
- Unit tests included
- Open-source friendly (MIT License)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up a Python virtual environment
3. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
4. Run examples in `examples/` to see the stack in action
5. Run tests in `tests/` to ensure reliability
